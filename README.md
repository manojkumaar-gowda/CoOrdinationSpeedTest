This app runs as php as backend server. Choose a hosting platform. I would recommend you to try 000webhost.com to host your php apps for free. Go create an account now.

Firstly,lets create a db

For the app to run db_name, db_username, password is required. Create your credentials first.

Now go to phpmyadmin of your app. Import the db which I have given in the code file db.sql

Now you have to make modificications to your code.

Replace all the db_name,db_username,password with your credentials.
